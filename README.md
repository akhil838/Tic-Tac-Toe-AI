This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation using the _**Minimax algorithm**_ for AI decision-making. The Minimax algorithm allows the computer to play optimally, guaranteeing a win or a draw against any opponent.

## Features
* Play against the computer using the Minimax AI.<br/>
* Clear visual representation of the game board.
## Requirements
* Programming language with libraries for handling 2D grids and user input (e.g., Python with CustomTkinter)
## How to Play
1. Install the Requirements<br/>
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
2. Run the game script.
3. Take turns marking empty spaces on the board by entering the corresponding cell number (usually 1-9 for a 3x3 grid).
4. The computer will make its move based on the Minimax algorithm.
5. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw.
